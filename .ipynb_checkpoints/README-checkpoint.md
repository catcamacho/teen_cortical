# Longitudinal Cortical Thickness Analysis for an adolescent sample
This repository is designed to process and subsequently analyze a longitudinal female adolescent sample recruited on a range of early life stress. This pipeline is still in progress, but here is the pipeline so far:

* Preprocessing (FreeSurfer autorecon 1 and 2)
* Template creation (FSL, FreeSurfer, ANTs)
* Cortical thickness estimation (ANTs)
* Hierarchical mixed effects modeling (statsmodel)
